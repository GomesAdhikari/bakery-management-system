Hi friends I have created a bakery management system in which it allows you to make orders for customers and export all of them in a csv file you can also make changes in the
orders like the name of the customer address of the customer And I have created this by using pandas library and using oops in python it also allows you to mark a pending order delivered.
I made this just for practicing oops with pandas because I'm new to pandas I hope you like the code and concept.
